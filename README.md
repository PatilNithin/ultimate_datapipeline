# Ultimate_datapipeline
Creating a ETL data pipeline - Extracting data from different source system to Google Big Query.
The idea is to create 4 data pipelines -
1. Retail Analytics Pipeline
2. IoT Device Telemetry Aggregation
3. Financial (Banking ) Transactions Pipeline (Fraud Detection Ready)
4. Medical Insurance data pipeline

1. Retail Analytics Pipeline

Use Case : 
Let's say there is a online retail company like Amazon . They want to devide their customers into Platinum,Dimond,Gold, Silver,Normal customers based on the customer monthly activity - on attributes like money_spent ,no_of_orders ,time_spent ....,
